<h2>His Childhood</h2>
<hr>
<p>Muhammad was not even seven years old when his mother died. After his motherâ€™s death, his grandfather Abdul-Muttalib was his guardian. Because of his knowledge of the status of the child and his faith in him, Abdul-Muttalib treated Muhammad with more care and attention than his other children. Muhammad was eight when his grandfather died, and he was taken into the care of his uncle Abu Talib.</p>
